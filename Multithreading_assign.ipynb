    "Multithreading is used in Python to achieve parallelism, where multiple threads can execute simultaneously, improving the efficiency of programs that involve tasks that can be performed concurrently. By utilizing multiple threads, a Python program can effectively utilize available system resources and handle multiple tasks concurrently, resulting in improved performance and responsiveness.\n",

    "-Improved Performance: Multithreading can lead to improved performance by allowing concurrent execution of tasks. It can utilize available system resources more efficiently and increase overall throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Responsiveness: Multithreading enhances the responsiveness of applications by keeping them interactive even while performing time-consuming tasks. Background tasks can be executed in separate threads, ensuring the main thread remains responsive to user interactions.\n",

    "-Resource Sharing: Threads within the same process share the same memory space, allowing for efficient sharing of data and resources. This eliminates the need for complex inter-process communication mechanisms and improves overall efficiency.\n",

    "-Complexity: Multithreading introduces complexity into program design and implementation. Coordination and synchronization between threads become essential to ensure correct and consistent results, which can be challenging to achieve.\n",

    "#QUESTION 6\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlocks and race conditions are two common synchronization issues that can occur in concurrent programming. Let's define each of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Deadlock:\n",
    "   - Deadlock refers to a situation where two or more threads or processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for a resource that the other holds.\n",
    "   - In a deadlock, the threads are stuck in a circular dependency, where each thread is waiting for a resource that will not be released until another thread releases the resource it is holding.\n",
    "   - Deadlocks can occur when there is a lack of proper synchronization or resource management, such as when multiple threads compete for exclusive access to shared resources without proper coordination.\n",
    "   - Deadlocks can lead to a system freeze or a state where the affected threads are unable to make progress, causing a significant disruption in program execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Race Condition:\n",
    "   - A race condition occurs when the behavior of a program depends on the relative timing or interleaving of multiple threads or processes.\n",
    "   - It arises when multiple threads access shared data or resources concurrently, and the final outcome depends on the order of execution.\n",
    "   - Race conditions can lead to unexpected and inconsistent results because the threads can access and modify shared data in an uncontrolled manner.\n",
    "   - These issues can occur when there is a lack of proper synchronization mechanisms to coordinate access to shared resources.\n",
    "   - Common examples of race conditions include problems like data corruption, incorrect calculations, and inconsistent program behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both deadlocks and race conditions are undesirable in concurrent programming and can lead to program failures and unexpected behavior. They require careful consideration and proper synchronization techniques to prevent or mitigate their occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid deadlocks, techniques such as resource allocation ordering, deadlock detection, and deadlock avoidance algorithms can be used. Proper use of locks, semaphores, or other synchronization primitives can help prevent race conditions by ensuring exclusive access to shared resources or implementing proper data synchronization mechanisms.\n",
